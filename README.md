## Testing
****

Extensive testing has been carried out to ensure that the site functions as intented. A single scroll page design was utilized to make navigating the site intuative and navigation is present for users who wish to go directly to a specific section of the site. 

The site layout of landing page > Launch infomation > sign up > retailers creates a natural flow for the user. An average user will want to see this information and in this order. 

Color is used to stimulate the user. To create feelings of anticipation and challenge the normal perceptions of 'what a website should look like'. This is intentional, as the company wants to show protential customers that they are not afriad to break the rules, that they are about to launch a clothing range that is something new and something exciting. Fashion and art is all about stimulation. Presenting challenges and emotions for the viewer. This website needed to do this, but in a way that did not leave the user feeling stranded or lost. Splitting the website into sections and alternating white and red backgrounds keeps the user engaged and supports their journey through the website. 

Soft feeling fonts are used across the website to act as a friendly voice against the dynamic design and color. The event information on the landing page was the only place a more impactive font was used, as it was an announcement that what to be direct, clear and not ignored.  

The site functions well on mobile and desktop devices. Three different screen widths were used to ensure the site looks good on all platforms. On mobile devices the color is the main element used to create an impactful site, whereas for the larger screens imaginative placements of text and images could be used to enhance the sites appeal.



### Challenges, Bugs and fixes

The scaling of the site was very challenging. I extensivly explored the various measurement units that could be used to control scaling (such: as px,vw,rem) and strived to use them to support my design goals for the sites. 

I have created my wireframes using Adobe XD and trying to translate them into reality proved challanging as in many section of the site the elements re-order when they are scaled. To solve this I read-up on Flex and learn how to order the elements. 

Padding and margins are extremly useful. When I started the project I was still a little unsure about how and when to use them. But as I got into the project I found my code was getting cleaner and my solutions were getting simplier.

I grew to rely on and use Google Inspect more and more through the course of the project. The ability to identify elements, edit live and identify the specific code line number supported in a productive work flow.

### Validator Testing
- HTML
    - No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator
- CSS
    -No errors were found when passing through the official (Jigsaw) validator

### Unfixed Bugs
The menu us my main bug. It works but it does not look great on mobile devices. An easy fix would have been to use Javascript. As this was a html/css project I felt it may have worked against my in the grading had I added Javascript to the project.

## Deployment
***
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub)

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
    - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
    - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch

## Credits
***


This project contains no external code. All the code in this project was written by myself. I used tutorials or forums to help me understand specific parts of code and solve desing problems. 

I met with a friend, who is a programmer, three or four times during the project. He was able to guide me on specific coding problems I was having.
