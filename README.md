## Testing
#### 
- Clear rational for the project
This a company that had a bold image. in-your-face but still designer. They needed a site that would instantly get a reaction of 'wow' or even 'what's next?!'.

- It's important to engage with the demographic and not to be afraid of excluding those outside of the target audience. Shock is a great way to do this. No over complicated, over informed and advertising - more focused on simple, key information with a dynamic design so you know that something new is about to enter the market.

- Key Project Goals: To stand out on the internet is hard. To stand out in the fashion sector is even harder. The goal was to represent a brand that wanted to create an instant impression and try and explore design in a fresh way.

- This is a core website that will be built upon with future releases. The current website represents the start of the journey and the start of a more complex website.
