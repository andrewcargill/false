## Testing
****

Extensive testing has been carried out to ensure that the site functions as intented. A single scroll page design was utilized to make navigating the site intitive and navigation is present for users who wish to go directly to a specific section of the site. 

The site layout of landing page > Launch infomation > sign up > retailers creates a natural flow for the user. An average user will want to see this information and in this order. 

Color is used to stimulate the user. To create feeling of shock and challenge the normal perseptions of 'what a website is'. This is intentional, as the company wants to stand out. It wants to show protential customers that they are not afriad to break the rules, that they are about to launch a clothing range that is something mew and dynamic. Fashion and art is all about stimulation. Asking questions and presenting challenges for the viewer. The website needed to do this, but in a way that did not leave the user alone or lost. Splitting the sections into white and red backgrounds keeps the stimulation for the user and supports their journey through the website. 

The site functions well on mobile and desktop devices. Three different screen widths were used to ensure the site looks good on all platforms.


The scaling of the site was very challenging. The use of space on a laptop and desktop screen had to be utilized in a very unconvertional way to try and carry the websites design vision. 


The landing page will only be used for the build up to the launch of the company. It is envisaged that once the company is launched the site will evolve to display the clothes and inspirations the company wishes to promote. This website will proivde a core for this future expansion and designing around the idea of negative space.


### Challenges, Bugs and fixes

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.*



### Validator Testing
- HTML
    - No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator
- CSS
    -No errors were found when passing through the official (Jigsaw) validator

### Unfixed Bugs
You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.

### Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub)

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
    - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
    - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
    - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
