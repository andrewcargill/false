# FALSE Urban Designer Clothing 
FALSE Urban Designer Clothing is a site to promote a new high-end clothing brand called 'FALSE' which will be launching its first clothing range during Paris Fashion Week 2022. Users will find out when the event is taking place and be encouraged to sign up for 'exclusive access' to a live-stream event.  

The site is targeted towards upper middle class / upper class men and women aged 20-40 years old. The demographic have a passion for, and invest in, high-end fashion. They demand modern, fresh and exciting clothing. 

The sites design is all geared around the companies need to be dynamic and stand out. 

The brief in short: Engage. Intrigue. Inform. Use Red.

The design layout aims to challenge conventions. We reference minamilist / abstract art and use negative space to give a simple and uncomplicated, but impacting result.

    - As the only black text on the screen, the user is drawn to the date and location. This is the most important information on the screen.

## Testing
****
Extensive testing has been carried out to ensure that the site functions as intended. A single scroll page design was utilized to make navigating the site intuitive, and navigation is present for users who wish to go directly to a specific section of the site. 

The site layout of landing page > Launch information > sign up > retailers creates a natural flow for the user. An average user will want to see this information and in this order. 

Color is used to stimulate the user. To create feelings of anticipation and challenge the normal perceptions of 'what a website should look like'. This is intentional, as the company wants to show potential customers that they are not afraid to break the rules, that they are about to launch a clothing range that is something new and something exciting. Fashion and art is all about stimulation. Presenting challenges and emotions for the viewer. This website needed to do this, but in a way that did not leave the user feeling stranded or lost. Splitting the website into sections and alternating white and red backgrounds keeps the user engaged and supports their journey through the website. 

Soft feeling fonts are used across the website to act as a friendly voice against the dynamic design and color. The event information on the landing page was the only place a more impactive font was used, as it was an announcement that what to be direct, clear and not ignored.  

The site functions well on mobile and desktop devices. Three different screen widths were used to ensure the site looks good on all platforms. On mobile devices, the color is the main element used to create an impactful site, whereas for the larger screens, imaginative placements of text and images could be used to enhance the site's appeal.

### Challenges, Bugs and fixes

The scaling of the site was very challenging. I extensively explored the various measurement units that could be used to control scaling (such: as px,vw,rem) and strived to use them to support my design goals for the sites. 

I created my wireframes using Adobe XD and trying to translate them into reality proved challenging as in many sections of the site the elements move as the screen size enlarges and then the elements re-order when they are scaled down to mobile devices. Flex  helped  me to create the desired effect, although I feel the site is visually stronger on laptops and monitors. 

Padding and margins are extremely useful! When I started the project, I was still a little unsure about how and when to use them. As the building progressed,  and my understanding grew, I could see that my code was getting cleaner and my solutions were getting simpler.

I grew to rely heavily on Google Inspect. The ability to identify elements, edit live and quickly identify specific code lines created a productive work flow.

The site is tested on Google Inspect using the various mobile phone emulations, and I used a MacBook Pro (2017) with a large external monitor for testing the large scaling of the site.  The site has only been tested on Google Chrome.

There were various small bugs and fixes along the way, which are documented in the GitHub commit history.

### Validator Testing
- HTML
    - No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator
- CSS
    -No errors were found when passing through the official (Jigsaw) validator

### Unfixed Bugs
The menu is my main bug. It works, but it does not look great on mobile devices. An easy fix would have been to use Java script to create a 'hamburger menu'. As this was a clear html/css project, I felt there was a risk the grading might work against me had I included Javascript in the project.

## Deployment
***
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub)

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
    - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
    - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
    - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
