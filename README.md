Clear rational for the project
This a company that had a bold image. in-your-face but still designer. They needed a site that would instantly get a reaction of 'wow' or even 'what's next?!'.

It's important to engage with the demographic and not to be afraid of excluding those outside of the target audience. Shock is a great way to do this. No over complicated, over informed and advertising - more focused on simple, key information with a dynamic design so you know that something new is about to enter the market.

Key Project Goals
Engage. Intrigue. Inform. Use Red.

To stand out on the internet is hard. To stand out in the fashion sector is even harder. The goal was to represent a brand that wanted to create an instant impression and try and explore design in a fresh way.

This is a core website that will be built upon with future releases. The current website represents the start of the journey and the start of a more complex website.

Target Audience
 Upper and upper middle class people aged between 20-40 years old. They are already interested in fashion and are in-tune with the latest trends and influences. They enjoy city living and career-building. They embrace change and enjoy digital enviorments and inovation.
